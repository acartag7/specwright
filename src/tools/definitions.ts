    description: `Execute multiple implementation chunks with GLM, with CONTEXT PASSING between chunks.

**This is the recommended tool for complex implementations.**

How it works:
1. You provide an array of task chunks + optional spec file
2. GLM executes each chunk IN ORDER
3. After each chunk, the orchestrator:
   - Scans for newly created files
   - Passes file list to next chunk
   - Tells next chunk what was already done
4. Results are aggregated and returned

**Context Passing**: Each chunk receives:
- List of files created by previous chunks
- Summary of what previous chunks accomplished
- The spec content (if specFile provided)

Example chunks for a parser:
- Chunk 1: "Create type definitions" → creates types.ts
- Chunk 2: "Implement parser" → knows types.ts exists, imports from it
- Chunk 3: "Add tests" → knows both files exist`,

4. **Fix (GLM)**: Fix any issues found

Within each stage, tasks respect dependencies:

- Utils depend on types
- Core depends on types + utils
- Tests depend on everything else
