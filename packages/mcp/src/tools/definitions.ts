    description: `Delegate a coding task to GLM-4.7 with real-time progress tracking.

GLM runs as a full Claude Code instance with file access via opencode.

Best for implementation tasks:
- Create files and implement features
- Fix bugs and refactor code
- Any coding task that needs file access

Progress is tracked via SSE events for real-time visibility.`,

    description: `Execute multiple implementation chunks with GLM sequentially.

How it works:
1. You provide an array of task chunks + optional spec file
2. GLM executes each chunk IN ORDER
3. Results are aggregated and returned

Example chunks for a parser:
- Chunk 1: "Create type definitions" → creates types.ts
- Chunk 2: "Implement parser" → knows types.ts exists
- Chunk 3: "Add tests" → knows both files exist`,
